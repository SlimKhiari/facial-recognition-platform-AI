It is an absence manager based on facial recognition in python (openCv).
To visualize student absences and manage their consequences, we have developed 1 web application in Java JEE, and 1 other in PHP (for visitors who will therefore have a different control procedure to that of people registered in the establishment) and MySQL. To open/close the door lock, we used an arduino board with the pyfirmata library for python on ubuntu. For the door, we made a mechanical design with CATIA software, then printed it in 3D.


  Adrien: mechanical design of the door + 3D printing

  Chahed: development of the Java JEE + MySQL web application

  Marouane: development of the application in PHP to manage visitors + MySQL

  Slim: facial recognition with the face recognition API (based on the SVM classifier) of python + MySQL (for the storage of presences in case of detection)

  Talha: MySQL database design + front end support
  
  Wassim: setting up the automatic lock with arduino + pyfirmata + wiring
